 - Portfolio personalization: You can choose the weight of every element on the portfolio.
 - Most common technical analysis indicators already integrated.
 - Execute orders on the most famous exchanges.
 - Possibility to visualize the asset allocation and the portfolio value charts for every strategy thanks to `alchemist-view <https://github.com/Dodo33/alchemist-view>`_.
 - Fully documented and hosted on `readthedocs <http://alchemist-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.
 

Supported Exchanges
===================
The following exchanges are available to trade on:

    - `Poloniex <https://poloniex.com/>`_
    - `Bittrex <https://bittrex.com/>`_

    
Requirements
============

 - Python3
 - Mysql
    

Installation
============

Installing with ``pip``:
------------------------
If python3-pip is already installed::
        
    $ pip3 install alchemist_lib
        
If you don't have pip installed, you can easily install it by downloading and running `get-pip.py <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>`_.
    
Cloning the repository with ``git``:
------------------------------------
If git is already installed::
        
    $ git clone https://github.com/Dodo33/alchemist-lib
    $ cd alchemist-lib
    $ python3 setup.py install


After the installation it's important to specify mysql credentials::

    $ sudo alchemist populate -l "hostname" -u "username" -p "password" -d "database_name"



Code example
============

The following strategy will analyse the trend for every cryptocurrency traded on Poloniex based on the slope of the linear regression.
It buys the top 5 assets whose slope is closed to zero. The more the slope is close to zero, the more weight the asset gets within the portfolio.
The procedure is repeated every 15 minutes.

Basic concepts
==============

Alchemist_lib works with three methods:

    - set_weights
    - select_universe
    - handle_data

*set_weights* is used to set the weight that an asset has respect the others within the portfolio. 
The sum of every weight must be close to 1. Must returns a pandas dataframe with two columns: "asset" and "alpha", where "asset" is the index.

*select_universe* filters the assets saved on the database and returns just the ones the strategy will take into consideration.

*handle_data* is the most importat one because it manages the trading logic. Must returns a pandas dataframe with two columns: "asset" and "alpha", where "asset" is the index.

You can find other examples in the ``examples`` directory.
