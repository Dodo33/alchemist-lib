Strategy description:
*Hold a portfolio equally composed by Ethereum and BitcoinCash.*

::
    
    from alchemist_lib.portfolio import LongsOnlyPortfolio
    from alchemist_lib.broker import PoloniexBroker
    from alchemist_lib.tradingsystem import TradingSystem
    import alchemist_lib.exchange as exch
    import pandas as pd


    def set_weights(df):
        df["weight"] = 0.5 #Because there are just two assets.
        return df

    def select_universe(session):
        poloniex_assets = exch.get_assets(session = session, exchange_name = "poloniex")

        my_universe = []
        for asset in poloniex_assets:
            if asset.ticker == "ETH" or asset.ticker == "BCH":
                my_universe.append(asset)
        return my_universe

    def handle_data(session, universe):
        #The value of alpha is useless in this case.
        df = pd.DataFrame(data = {"asset" : universe, "alpha" : 0}, columns = ["asset", "alpha"]).set_index("asset")
        return df


    algo = TradingSystem(name = "BuyAndHold",
                         portfolio = LongsOnlyPortfolio(capital = 0.02),
                         set_weights = set_weights,
                         select_universe = select_universe,
                         handle_data = handle_data,
                         broker = PoloniexBroker(api_key = "APIKEY",
                                                 secret_key = "SECRETKEY"),
                         paper_trading = True)
    algo.run(delay = "15M", frequency = 1)



Basic concepts
==============

Alchemist_lib works with three methods:

    - set_weights
    - select_universe
    - handle_data

*set_weights* is used to set the weight that an asset has respect the others within the portfolio. 
The sum of every weight must be close to 1. Must returns a pandas dataframe with two columns: "asset" and "alpha", where "asset" is the index.

*select_universe* filters the assets saved on the database and returns just the ones the strategy will take into consideration.

*handle_data* is the most importat one because it manages the trading logic. Must returns a pandas dataframe with two columns: "asset" and "alpha", where "asset" is the index.

You can find other examples in the ``examples`` directory.
